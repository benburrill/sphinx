Sphinx ISA
==========

Emulator
--------
``spasm``, the Sphinx assembler/emulator, requires a recent version of
Python, I think >= 3.10.  I use Python 3.11.

To run the countdown example: ``python3.11 -m spasm examples/countdown.s``

Alternatively, you may install the ``spasm`` executable:

.. code:: sh

    $ pip3.11 install --editable .
    $ spasm examples/countdown.s

**NOTE:**
Due to the unfortunate limitations of traditional processors, the
emulator may require an exponential amount of memory and time to perform
jump instructions in some cases, based on the amount of state.  On a
true Sphinx architecture, the jump instruction is specified to take one
clock cycle.

Instructions
------------

Arguments to most instructions in Sphinx can be any of the following
forms::

    ARG = IMMED | [IMMED] | {IMMED}

- IMMED - immediate values.  These can be any assembly-time expression
  using labels and numeric literals.  For example: ``8``, ``my_label``,
  or ``('B' + 3) * 2``.
- [IMMED] - state values.  The immediate value within the square
  brackets is used as an address to look up a value in the state section
  (main memory) at runtime.  State values take the place of registers in
  a normal assembly language, but are backed by memory.  For example:
  ``[my_label]``, or ``[arr + 5w]``
- {IMMED} - const values.  They are just like state values, but look up
  values in the (read-only) const section instead, which usually holds
  the inputs to the program.  For example: ``{input_number}``

Instructions are allowed in the code section only.

swso, sbso                                       swso ARG, ARG, ARG      Again, adds an offset.  Note that the offset is given by

flag                                             flag IDENTIFIER         Indicates program status.  The identifier can be anything,
