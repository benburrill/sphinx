; Determines the max value in an array and then halts

; Non-trivial halting programs are tricky in Sphinx.  Unlike max.s, we
; will not be able to make use of Sphinx's predictive powers, but we can
; still write a conventional algorithm to finds the max value.
; Also, although it's fairly easy to write programs that either halt or
; not halt for an arbitrarily complicated reason, if we want the program
; to produce arbitrary output based on a computation and then halt, we
; need to use non-static jumps (along the real path of execution, all
; jumps must be taken in a halting program, but that doesn't mean that
; the same jump always always needs to go to the same place).

; So the strategy in writing non-trivial halting Sphinx programs is to
; turn your conditionals into a boolean 0 or 1 and then look up the
; address to jump to based on that.

; Currently I haven't added bitwise operators, but we don't need 'em
; NOTE: division by 0 causes div to leave the output unchanged.
; To test if x is non-zero (1 if non-zero, 0 if zero):
;   mov [test], [x]
;   div [test], [test], [test]

; Get sign of x (1 if positive, 0 if negative, 2 if zero):
;   add [test], [x], 1
;   add [temp], [x], 2
;   div [test], [temp], [test]

; To test if x is greater than or equal to y (assuming both positive):
;   div [test], [x], [y]
;   div [test], [test], [test]
