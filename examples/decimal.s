; This prints a decimal expansion of a fraction, with repeating portion
; in parentheses, without any redundant digits.

; Repeating fractions are detected in a bit of an interesting way.  You
; can't avoid infinite loops in Sphinx the way you can halting, but what
; this program does is optimistically guess that a repetition will begin
; at each digit.  If the guess is correct, the loop will run until that
; state repeats and then breaks out to terminal non-termination.  If the
; guess would have been wrong, a slow cycle detector (tortoise and hare)
; is used to eventually halt the loop, but only AFTER we would have
; broken out if the guess was correct.  So we can use a jump instruction
; to test for that halt, and if would occur, we can guess that the next
; digit will be where the loop starts instead.
; In other words: it's the tortoise, the hare, and the time-traveler

; This program also demonstrates the use of the byte output format.

%format output byte

; 32 bit words -- terrifying!
; Some fractions, eg reciprocals of "full reptend" primes can use up a
; fair bit of memory, but it's less apocalyptic than you might imagine,
; at least if you're not trying too hard to break things.

%section state
; 84823/27000 is a pretty inefficient rational approximation of pi,
; specifically designed so that the repeating portion occurs after a
; non-repeating part.
num: .word 84823
den: .word 27000

; Some other nice fractions: 511/1024, 100/336, 1/308927

; Known bugs:
; * The maximum safe denominator is, I think, ~1/100th of the maximum
;   representable signed power of 10, due to div/mod being signed.
;   Beyond that, some denominators will work, but you can also get a
;   variety of fun behavior: infinite loops of digits (sometimes, but
;   not always preceded by crazy memory use), and crashes.
